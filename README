    Ok, so this is the repository for all of the website code.  You will probably
have to download the git software if you want to be able to make changes off of
github.
    The basic idea is that you make a change, you fork the repo, make a
branch for the change (this allows you to keep the main branch of the fork up
to date as other people make changes) and submit a pull request to have your
edits/additions added to the main branch (main).  
    The goal behind using github is that it facilitates developer
communications and it keeps a running log of all of the edits we make so if we
break/delete/lose/get-haxxored, everything is right here.  It's also really
pretty looking and easy to use (relative to emailing code back and forth, trust
me).
    Check back here later and I'll probably have some code conventions and more
detailed instructions on everything.

NOTE: I don't have infinity disk space on this account so don't commit images 
(there are exceptions to this, just dont do it for now)!!

tl;dr
